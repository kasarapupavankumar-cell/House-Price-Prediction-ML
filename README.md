# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds a robust machine learning model to predict house prices based on 
various features such as quality, area, garage type, air conditioning, etc.

## 🛠️ Steps Followed
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (missing values, outliers, encoding, scaling)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (univariate & bivariate)
- Feature Selection (correlation & multicollinearity handling)
- Model Building:
  - Linear Regression
  - Ridge Regression
  - Lasso Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boost
  - XGBoost (Best Model)
- Model Evaluation using MAE, MSE, RMSE, R², Adjusted R²
- Residual Analysis & Feature Importance Interpretation

## 🏆 Best Model
XGBoost Regression achieved the best performance with:
- Highest R² score
- Lowest error metrics
